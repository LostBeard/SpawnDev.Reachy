/// way to drive a robot from a hosted page is WebRTC, signalled through a central Hugging Face Space
/// which also validates the HF OAuth token and lists the robots on your account. Pollen document the JS
/// <b>API</b> but not the signalling <b>wire protocol</b>, so reimplementing it would mean
/// reverse-engineering an undocumented protocol against a server we do not control and that can change
/// server-side. Wrapping is the supported path, and the one their own apps and desktop app use.
